# Hello all
    I am Dunia Al Kilani ;
    I studied Electrical engineering at the Hashemite University , Immediately after my graduation, I was employed  as sales and technical Engineer at Tal Group.
    To be honest, I did not find myself in the field of electrical engineering much, so I decided to start 
    learning programming. I think it is the language of the age and the most important science now.
    I aspire to develop myself a lot in the field of programming, and get a job in this field. Wish me luck !
